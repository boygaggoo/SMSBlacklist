# SMSBlacklist
An Android app to prevent unwanted text messages from popping up on the notification bar. Not intentionally losing messages is my primary design concern.

## Oh no!

As I no longer have an Android device that can receive text messages, 
there will be ***no further development for this app***. 

Unless of course I get a phone for testing.

## Requirements

* Eclipse 
* the [ADT plugin](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html)
* API level 4 SDKs

## Try it out
